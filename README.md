# Player-Analytics-Platform
Soccer player analytics platform with ML-powered team selection

Premier League Analytics Platform
A comprehensive soccer analytics platform that processes real Premier League data to analyze player performance and optimize team selection using machine learning.

Project Overview
This project demonstrates advanced data engineering and machine learning skills by building a complete soccer analytics system from the ground up. Starting as a former professional soccer player, I leveraged my domain expertise to create meaningful insights from complex sports data.

Key Features:
Real Data Integration: Processes 800+ Premier League players from the 2024-25 season
Multi-Source Data Merging: Combines player stats, team information, and performance metrics from multiple CSV sources
Advanced Analytics: Calculates performance metrics, averages, and player comparisons
Team Management: Sophisticated player search and team organization systems
Machine Learning Ready: Foundation built for ML-powered team selection algorithms

Technical Architecture:

Background:
I'm a former professional soccer player transitioning to software engineering, combining 10+ years of sports expertise with modern programming skills. This project demonstrates how domain knowledge can drive meaningful technical innovation. Im looking to add services and platforms like this to my Consulting Firm, which was created to help aspiring professional soocer players and their familes navigate the process of development on and off the field. Having platforms that can present palyer tendencies, trends and statistics can be a great way to help players develop and mold their game. It also give parents who may not have much expereince in the soccer world a clear idea of what is required to navigate this space and protect their childrens dreams, most importnatly, making sure players get positive experiences from the game of soccer.
