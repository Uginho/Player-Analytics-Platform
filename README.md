Player Analytics Platform
A comprehensive soccer data analytics platform built by a former professional player, combining domain expertise with modern software engineering to deliver actionable insights for player development and performance analysis.
Project Overview
This platform processes comprehensive Premier League data to provide detailed player performance analytics and statistical insights. Built with real-world soccer expertise, it addresses the critical need for data-driven player development tools in youth soccer, helping aspiring players, parents, and coaches make informed decisions about development pathways.
The system currently processes 800+ Premier League player records, providing statistical analysis that bridges the gap between professional soccer insights and accessible data visualization for families navigating the competitive soccer landscape.
Background
I'm a former professional soccer player transitioning to software engineering, combining 10+ years of sports expertise with modern programming skills. This project demonstrates how domain knowledge can drive meaningful technical innovation. I'm looking to add services and platforms like this to my Consulting Firm, which was created to help aspiring professional soccer players and their families navigate the process of development on and off the field.
Having platforms that can present player tendencies, trends and statistics can be a great way to help players develop and mold their game. It also gives parents who may not have much experience in the soccer world a clear idea of what is required to navigate this space and protect their children's dreams, most importantly, making sure players get positive experiences from the game of soccer.
